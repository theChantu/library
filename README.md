# **library [LIVE-VIEW](#https://mrchantu.github.io/library/)**
A library project I made for [The Odin Project](#https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

## What does the code do?
It generates every single object from the books array onto the page everytime you remove or make something read or not.

## Time it took me to finish: 7 hours.
